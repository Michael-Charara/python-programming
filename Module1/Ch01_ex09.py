# Write a Python program that will assign values to three variables and print them.The first variable should contain the string “Python”, the second should contain the integer 10, and the third should contain the floating point value 1000.0.

# Prompt user for a number
number_str = input("Enter a number: ")
# Store the given number into a variable
number = int(number_str)
# Perform arithmetic operations with number
# take number, add 2, multiply by 3, subtraact 6, and divide by 3
n = (((number + 2)*3)-6)/3  # division
# display the values
print('Number Entered: ', number)
# display the result
print('Result: ', n)
